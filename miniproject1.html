	<p>Hello name is Alexandria Branner, I was born and raised in San Francisco California.<br>
	I have a 13-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter who are my world, I enjoy going to amusement<br>
	parks, traveling trying new things with my children. I love reading, learning new things, reaching<br>
	One day I plan to go whale watching, I would like to see Orcas first time I saw an Orcas was at<br>
	Six Flags Discovery Kingdom ever since then I have been fascinated with Orcas.</p>&nbsp;
	<p>What made me interested in Web Development I would say it started with Myspace when I was<br>
	a teenager. When I think about it I was doing a form of web development, just by creating the<br>
	layout to the background to my Myspace page. I would go to a background layout website and<br>
	copy the code and change the color or font, I had fun doing this and seeing the outcome from<br>
	playing around with the code. Someone had told me about <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> so I had created an<br>
	account and started learning this website starts you off with a roadmap to web development.<br>
	One of my favorite web pages. I use a lot is <a href="https://www.10bestdesign.com/dirtymarkup/" target="_blank">Clean up that code</a> this helps cleans up our code makes<br>
	it easier to read not only for you but for others.</p><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development" target="_blank">History of Web Development</a>
