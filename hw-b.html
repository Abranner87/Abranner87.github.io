				<p>One of my favorite books is It's All In Your Head by Russ. I can read this book<br>
				million times. I fall in love with this book every time I read or listen to it on<br>
				audio, I love this book so much I have the hard copy and the audio.</p>
				<p>The chapter that speaks to me the most is "Don't Fall For It". Which starts on<br>
				page 113 as I was listening to this chapter the author said something that opened<br>
				my eyes "The reason someone will tell you something is unrealistic is that you<br>
				haven't done it yet, and deeper than that, THEY themselves haven't done it yet."</p>
				<p>This chapter made me realize I do not need to play it safe and work the typical<br>
				"Good Career Job". I was doing what others from my community would've been<br>
				happy with what they would settle with. This chapter helped me decide to go back<br>
				to school and follow my dreams.</p>
