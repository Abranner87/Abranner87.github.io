			<p>My understanding about SEO is to put your webpage in front of viewers. Kinda reminds me<br>
			of making a YouTube video. You do not want any viewers coming to your site, you want your<br>
			targeted audience or it's pointless.</p>
			<h2>SEO Checklist</h2>
			<article>
				<ul>
					<li>Title Element</li>
					<li>Keywords and Phrases</li>
					<li>Description/Meta Tag</li>
					<li>Content</li>
					<li>Accessibility</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Title Element</h3>
				<p>"It's important to use high-quality titles on your page"-Google</p>
				<p>Sometimes it will be a struggle finding a title that will grab your targeted audience.</p>
				<h4>Keywords and Phrases</h4>
				<p>Keywords and phrases will help your site get picked up by search engines. Keywords will<br>
				bring traffic to your webpage, make sure you use keywords and phrases that will bring the<br>
				you are trying to attract. Example if you are making a site about Whale Watching, and add<br>
				phrases "Come see the sea turtles." Your target audience is Whale Watchers not people that<br>
				want to see sea turtles, that is pointless.</p>
				<p>Start your title tag with a keyword the keyword should be at the top of the page. You<br>
				look for about 20-30 popular phrases that you believe your targeted audience will be<br>
				looking for. I know when I Google something I am looking for similar words before I<br>
				click on the link. Say if I do click on the link and it has nothing to do with<br>
				what I am looking for I leave the website.</p>
